# Simple hexo API

## Installation

Place the content of the `scripts` folder of this repo inside the `scripts` folder of your hexo installation (create it if necessary).

## API specifications

**The api is specifically tailored to our website.** Feel free to modify it as you like

### `GET /api/posts/list`

Returns a json object with `id`, `title`, `author`, `date`, `picture` and `url`

### `POST /api/post/content/by-id`

Data should be `application/json`, and should contain an `id` property

It returns an object with the same properties as the previous endpoint plus a `content` property,
which contains the html-formatted content.

### `POST /api/post/content/by-uri`

Same as above, but takes a json object with `id_suffix` as a substring of the end of an article id and `sanitized_title` which should match the
title given in an uri.

The function that sanitizes a title is the following: 

```javascript
const sanitize = title => title.match(/[a-z ]/gi).join('').replace(/ /g, '-').toLowerCase();
```

### `GET /icon/by-language/:language`

Replace `:language` with the language you want the icon of. The result is an svg from devicon.

## Dependencies

This API depends on `body-parser` ~~and `devicons`~~. Please make sure to clone the repo recursively.
